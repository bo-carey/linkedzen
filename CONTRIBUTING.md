# **Contributing to LinkedZen**  

Thank you for considering contributing to LinkedZen! We welcome contributions of all types to improve the extension. This guide will walk you through how to get involved.  

## **How to Contribute**  

### 1. **Open an Issue**  
Before making any changes, please:  
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/bo-carey/linkedzen/issues) tab to see if your idea or bug report is already being discussed.  
- If it’s not listed, open a new issue to propose your idea or describe the bug.  
- Wait for approval or feedback before proceeding.  

### 2. **Claim or Discuss an Issue**  
If you’d like to work on an issue, please comment on it to let us know. This helps avoid duplicate efforts.  

### 3. **Fork the Repository**  
- Once an issue has been assigned to you or approved for work, fork the repository.  
- Clone your fork to your local machine.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedzen.git
```

### 4. **Work on Your Changes**  
- Make sure your changes align with the existing code style and guidelines.  
- Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work across both Chrome and Firefox.  

### 5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
- Push your changes to your fork.  
- Open a pull request against the main repository, referencing the issue you worked on (e.g., *Closes #XX* in the PR description).  

### 6. **Wait for Review**  
A project maintainer will review your pull request. They may request changes or suggest improvements. Please be responsive to feedback!

## **Code Guidelines**  

### **Style**

- Ensure your code is formatted consistently with the existing project (use a linter if one is configured).  

### **Testing**  
- Test your changes in both Chrome and Firefox to ensure cross-browser compatibility.  
- If applicable, provide instructions or screenshots for how to verify your changes.

## **Things to Keep in Mind**

- Open an issue first if you’re proposing a new feature or significant changes.  
- Contributions should align with LinkedZen’s goal: reducing noise and distractions on LinkedIn.
